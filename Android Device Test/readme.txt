Please note that this repository does not include any modules that were collaboratively created, updated or maintained by other team members.
None of the propeietary library calls or names are present; instead, they have been replaced with pseudocode. 
Furthermore, no specific details regarding organizational processes or information are included. 
I personally designed and implemented all the code from scratch, without any external assistance. 
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my individual style and approach to designing and implementing modules for generic functions.

I introduced the state transition mechanism to the team and demonstrated its benefits through these codes. 
One major advantage is the modularity it brings, as we only need to handle actions relvant to the current state. This approach clarifies the scope and responsibilities of each state, 
making the code more focused and easier to understand.
The logic and flow of the automation are improved by eliminating redundant and unnecesary checks, ensuring a streamlined and efficient process. 
Additionally, the state transition mechanism simplifies error handling and recovery, making it easier to maintain update error handling procedures.
